https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/Convoluted%20Boot

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

Some nodes in our data center have been producing unexpected errors and crash for a while now. When analyzing the systems offline, we couldn't find anything wrong with them. After a very throurough investigation, we think we have it nailed down to the netboot server handling the distributions on the PXE network, we suspect a bootkit is involved. Can you figure out what is happening?
